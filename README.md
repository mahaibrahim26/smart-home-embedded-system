# Smart Home Embedded System

This repository contains the final project report for a smart home embedded system developed using a Raspberry Pi 4.

The project integrates multiple sensors and actuators into a single IoT system using MQTT for communication and Grafana for real-time monitoring.

## What's Included
- Full technical report (PDF)
- Hardware setup images
- Grafana dashboard screenshots

## System Highlights
- Temperature & humidity monitoring (DHT11)
- Motion-based lighting control (PIR + LEDs)
- Distance-based gate control (Ultrasonic + Servo)
- Water tank monitoring and pump control (ADC + Relay)
- MQTT-based decoupled architecture
- Time-series monitoring using Grafana
